These are scripts that makes my life easier

enable-ssh : a script that creates an ssh key if a one is not there, then scp that key to the server.
rm2mp3: a script that I use to convert rm files to mp3 or ogg, actually it can be used to convert any format readable by mplayer, it uses lame for mp3, and vorbis-tools for ogg.
IMAP/appendMessage: a script that I use to append a message to an IMAP mailbox.
IMAP/countInbox: a script to count the number of messages in an IMAP mailbox.
